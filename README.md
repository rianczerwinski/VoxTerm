# VOXTERM

Local real-time voice transcription TUI with speaker diarization and P2P collaborative transcription. Runs entirely offline — no cloud APIs, no audio stored.

## Privacy & Storage Policy

VoxTerm is **local first and private by default**. Everything runs on your machine. Nothing is ever sent to a server.

- **No audio is stored.** Microphone input is processed in real-time and discarded. Only text transcripts are saved.
- **Voice profiles are encrypted at rest.** Speaker embeddings (biometric data used to recognize voices across sessions) are encrypted with AES-256-CBC. The key lives in your macOS Keychain — zero config.
- **Transcripts are yours.** Auto-saved as markdown to `~/Documents/voxterm/`. Never uploaded anywhere.
- **P2P stays on your LAN.** Party mode shares transcripts over your local network only. No relay servers.
- **Delete everything anytime.** Press `P` → delete to permanently wipe all voice data from disk.

## Party Mode (P2P)

Multiple people in the same room can share transcripts over the local network. Each laptop captures its closest speaker best — the combined result is better than any single mic.

**Press N** to join the party. Press N again to leave. No codes, no configuration.

- Auto-discovers nearby VoxTerm peers via mDNS
- Auto-joins the nearest party, or hosts one if none found
- Each party gets a unique color — all peers see the same color
- Encrypted transcript sharing (AES-256-GCM)
- Everyone sees who joins and leaves — no silent surveillance

See [docs/party-mode-design.md](docs/party-mode-design.md) for the full design.

## Voice Tagging

VoxTerm learns and remembers speaker voices across sessions:

1. Record a conversation — speakers are detected as "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.
2. Press `T` to name them — type a name, press Enter
3. Next session, VoxTerm auto-recognizes returning speakers
4. The more you tag, the less you need to — the system learns over time

Press `P` to manage your speaker profile library (rename, delete, wipe all data).

## Models

- **qwen3-0.6b** (default) — fast, good for most use
- **qwen3-1.7b** — more accurate, larger
- Whisper variants (tiny through large-v3) available via `M` menu

Models download automatically on first use.
